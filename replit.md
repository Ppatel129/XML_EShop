# E-commerce Product Search System

## Overview

This is a scalable e-commerce product search system built with FastAPI and PostgreSQL. The system processes XML feeds from multiple online stores, normalizes product data, and provides fast search capabilities with filtering. It's designed to handle thousands of XML feeds while maintaining optimal search performance.

## System Architecture

### Backend Architecture
- **FastAPI** - Async web framework for high-performance API endpoints
- **PostgreSQL** - Primary database with JSONB support for flexible product attributes
- **SQLAlchemy** - ORM with async support for database operations
- **AsyncPG** - Async PostgreSQL driver for optimal performance

### Frontend Architecture
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - Lightweight client-side application
- **Bootstrap 5** - CSS framework for responsive UI
- **Static files** - Served directly by FastAPI

## Key Components

### 1. Data Models (models.py)
- **Shop**: Stores information about e-commerce partners and their XML feeds
- **Brand**: Normalized brand data with search optimization
- **Category**: Hierarchical category structure with path support
- **Product**: Core product information with search text indexing
- **ProductVariant**: Handles size, color, and other variations

### 2. XML Feed Processing (xml_parser.py, feed_scheduler.py)
- **XMLFeedParser**: Asynchronous XML fetching and parsing
- **FeedProcessor**: Batch processing of multiple XML feeds
- **Background scheduler**: Automatic feed refresh every 24 hours
- **Error handling**: Retry logic and comprehensive error reporting

### 3. Search Service (search_service.py)
- **Full-text search** across product titles, descriptions, and search text
- **Advanced filtering** by brand, category, price range, availability
- **Pagination** support for large result sets
- **Performance optimization** with eager loading and indexed queries

### 4. Configuration Management (config.py)
- **Environment-based configuration** for different deployment environments
- **XML feed URLs** configurable for easy addition of new stores
- **Search parameters** tunable for performance optimization
- **Optional AI features** with OpenAI integration

## Data Flow

1. **Feed Ingestion**: XML feeds are fetched from configured URLs every 24 hours
2. **Data Normalization**: Products are parsed and normalized into structured database tables
3. **Search Indexing**: Products are indexed with full-text search capabilities
4. **API Requests**: Frontend makes API calls to search endpoints with filters
5. **Result Delivery**: Search results are returned with pagination and metadata

## External Dependencies

### Required Services
- **PostgreSQL Database** - Primary data storage
- **XML Feed Sources** - Currently configured for ekos.gr and beq.gr

### Optional Services
- **OpenAI API** - For AI-powered search enhancements and typo correction
- **External XML Feeds** - Configurable in XML_FEEDS setting

### Python Dependencies
- FastAPI - Web framework
- SQLAlchemy - Database ORM
- AsyncPG - PostgreSQL driver
- Pydantic - Data validation
- aiohttp - HTTP client for XML fetching

## Deployment Strategy

### Production Deployment
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with connection pooling (20 connections, 30 overflow)
- **Application**: FastAPI server with async capabilities
- **Static Files**: Served directly by FastAPI
- **Background Tasks**: Automated feed processing scheduler

### Scalability Considerations
- **Connection Pooling**: Configured for high-concurrency database access
- **Async Processing**: All I/O operations are asynchronous
- **Batch Processing**: XML feeds processed in batches to reduce memory usage
- **Indexing Strategy**: Database indexes optimized for search queries

### Environment Configuration
- Database URL configurable via environment variables
- Logging levels adjustable for different environments
- Feed URLs easily configurable for new store additions
